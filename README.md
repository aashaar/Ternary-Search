	- The list is stored in the array A. For testing, the user may change the list.
	- The program will display the array when the execution is started.
	- It'll then request an input from the user for a value to be searched in the list.
	- If the value is found, the program will return it's position in the list
	- Otherwise, it'll return a message : Value not found.

>> Please refer the output screenshots present in the same folder.

>> Note: The list here is directly passed in the main function, we can easily tweak the program to take the input from the user to make this more dynamic.
