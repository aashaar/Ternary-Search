Write a RECURSIVE program to do Ternary Search.
Ternary search is just like Binary search:
	In Binary Search, the list is divided into 2 parts. Similarly, in Ternary Search the list is divided into 3 parts instead of 2.
Tasks:
a. Create an array of at least 15 values in sorted order - descending.
b. do tertiary search to find an item.  I,e in stead of dividing the list into 2 halves, divide it into 3 parts.
c. run the program to find an existing item in the list
d. Second time run the program to try and find a non existing item in the list.
e. submit code and screen shot of execution.
